title: The Road Not Taken
---

一个人留在宿舍就会胡思乱想些东西

比如会和外表淑女内心刚烈的刘爷一起吐槽词汇老师

比如会独自去看一场《大闹天宫》的3D电影

比如会心中突然冒出个个支教的念头

宿舍同学一个一个的走掉

正如我选择的道路上同行人越来越少

屈服于现实的人很多

无法强迫谁谁谁如何如何

也许每人都有自己的想法与难处

幸运的是我还没有被现实磨圆棱角

Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,

And sorry I could not travel both

And be one traveler, long I stood

And looked down one as far as I could

To where it bent in the undergrowth;

Then took the other, as just as fair,

And having perhaps the better claim,

Because it was grassy and wanted wear;

Though as for that the passing there

Had worn them really about the same,

And both that morning equally lay

In leaves no step had trodden black.

Oh, I kept the first for another day!

Yet knowing how way leads on to way,

I doubted if I should ever come back.

I shall be telling this with a sigh

Somewhere ages and ages hence:

Two roads diverged in a wood,and I—

I took the one less traveled by,

And that has made all the difference.

既然是自己选择的道路

踽踽独行也好，荆棘遍布也罢

我会一直风雨兼程
